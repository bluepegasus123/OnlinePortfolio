							<p class='col-sm-7'><strong>Project Objective: To create an applicable process that manipulates images in any way including masking, shading, etc. This process must be presentable to a client or a reasonable cause.</strong></p>
							<p class="col-sm-7">In the PLTW Computer Science Class at Dublin High School, I used my knowledge of the Python language to make a group of images be able to morph into one image. We were deciding to create a final image of all the elements of trash being thrown into a trash can, and with a bold statement about how it was right to recycle. We were planning on making this presentable towards a client that was interested in an environmental cause. We started with Anurag working on the code, and Rish and I started to work on the project log. The project log consisted of our ideas, our logs everyday, and explained our project which can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GyNrUnJ7zxDHRRKedXiLKZJV2r6TAtIsnPdstI_pcJE/edit">here</a>. Not only that, but the code also required an extensive amount of work due to the fact that it was mainly code based. We faced a lot of errors and had some positive feedback, but we wanted to make it our best effort yet since we wanted to make an impact on the client, which was our teacher. Primarily, my role in all of this was to act as a facilitator and to make sure that we were getting work done and that everyone was on task. I would mostly spend my time working on the Image Manipulation log, that it turned out to be perfect and open to positive reviews. Overall, this project was great because I learned a lot of things, including how to work as a team.</p>

							<p class='col-sm-7'><strong>Project Objective: To create a marketable and successful Android application using the MIT App Inventor interface. Use an existing game, and build up on that and rebuild your own game.</strong></p>
							<p class="col-sm-7">In the PLTW Computer Science Class at Dublin High School, I used what I knew about MIT App Inventor, and made a game app with my classmates, Anurag and Felix. We created a "do-over" for the existing "Get the Gold" app and added new features to make it more better. This project taught me how there were errors in even the most perfect and professional things in the world, and that no engineer was ever "done" with his/her projects. The important thing in this project was to keep track of our progress and how we were doing so far, and having a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xKl2bwpT1Xa2oINiPca3ZQBCmbGtQEkziF_2dUHbVwk/edit">journal</a> helped us do that. In this journal, it was important to us to keep a log of what we were doing, other people's feedback on our project, and we stored our main links and information about our project there as well. In this project, my role was to look through the pieces of code and to make sure that everything was running right. I was practically debugging everything and adding new code if something was wrong. This project taught me that it is very important to have a reference of what you were doing for a project in a journal, since you might need to look back for references or past information. There were many instances where my partner and I wouldn't get along very well and would not agree with each other, but we eventually overcame that and successfully finished our project.</p>

						<p class='col-sm-7'><strong>Project Objective: To create a marketable Scratch game/animation that is interactive with the user. This project should be able to have a journal alongside, and there should be user input into the game as well.</strong></p>
						<p class="col-sm-7">In the PLTW Computer Science Class at Dublin High School, I used my knowledge of the Scratch language to make an animation with my partner, Sneha. We made an animation based on a medieval type of story, with a brave knight trying to avenge his father, but failing. Working on this project was an interesting experience, as I gained a lot of knowledge about Scratch, but also found out why teamwork was necessary in huge projects like this, since it will help get the work finished more efficiently. My partner and I kept track of our project's progress through a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15JDDhXk8D24TOhjJ_TdQCW_jw0lh1tAHE8HElo2eqow/edit">journal</a> that we used. It was digital, so we had to keep a log of what we were doing everyday on the project, our brainstorming, what our design steps for the project were, and other people's feedback. All of this was stored here, and it was important, as we can refer back to it anytime we want to, since it is stored in a digital document online. My role in this project was to mainly do most of the Scratch coding and to build the code step by step to make sure the project was working. This entire project taught me that teamwork is vital in big projects like this, as individuals working by themselves will take longer and will be less efficient than a group. There were times when one person in our group would hoard all the work for himself, but we soon figured out a plan for who would do which part of the game.</p>
