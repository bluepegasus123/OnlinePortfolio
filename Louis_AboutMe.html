					<p>I am William Louis, a rising sophomore in Dublin High School. Overall, I am an engineering student who has a strong base in coding different languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I also have leadership skills, as I have experience leading a group of boys in my Boy Scouts organization. Aside from my engineering experiences, I take rigorous academic courses including AP Statistics and Honors Chemistry, which both are very STEM related. I want to attend a prestigious university and earn my Computer Science major over there, and after I want to become a software engineer.</p>
					<p>I have been actively participating in the DHS Robotics Club, where my team and I work on building a VEX robot to compete with other teams from all over the world in competitions. Being in this club builds my team work skills, as I have to work with 7 other students for a year to build a successful robot. Recently, our team qualified for the Worlds competition where we will compete with numerous teams from other countries! I am also in the GaelForce Build Club, where I also participate in many competitions like the Google Science Fair and the Alameda County Science Fair. I plan on building a "Solar Hat" with my team of 4, and to place high in our upcoming competitions. I am also in the DHS Track and Field Team, which gives me discipline and consistency.</p>
